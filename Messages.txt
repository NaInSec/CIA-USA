Whether you feel lucky or not with what you've been given (or earned) as your opportunity to work, you're ultimately just a steward of it for a relatively brief period in time.

It will be handed off to someone else at some point.

If you thought of that work as being put in a box to be given to someone else, what would you want the recipient to think when he opened it up?

Wouldn't you want it to be something that's difficult to improve on?

Wouldn't you want him to crack open that box ... look in ... smile ... and say, "Wow. That's great work.""  God is talking to me this morning. Thank you for letting Him speak through you.

Message Body :Not by much and you can sit the bar anywhere you want. Side note: Shelly probably won't be able to run again. She hurt her back Thursday and had an MRI. L5-S1 rupture. Really unfortunate. This may sound crazy to you but running together was one of the only things that was just ours. The only time we actually talked about life. Anyway she is on steroids, pain medication, and muscle relaxers. Maybe it's time to slow everything down.

I was able to get a lawyer in Portland to help my uncle and aunt. A drunk driver hit them earlier this week and they (Tony and Pam) are in the hospital. Broken hips, hands, soft tissue injuries. The guy that hit them is an Aussie and was traveling at 120 mph. I am glad my family survived. We are excited for the board results. I don't know if Corbin is meeting this one. He said they were concerned with his weight. He is a strong guy and I imagine he would meet criteria after being taped. How are you and the family?

This last Friday, the Air Force selected me for direct appointment into the JAG Corps. With that said Shelly and I will remain in Oklahoma for at least a another year. Perhaps more if I am stationed at Tinker. A friend and classmate of mine, Jace White is very interested in your firm and I told him about you and Ainslie. If you are still considering the option of bringing someone on, I recommend Jace. He is incredibly smart and capable. Newly married and looking to settle down in Edmond. I wanted you to have a heads up in case he reaches out to you in the next few days. He is one of the few students ranked higher than me and is a really good guy. I hope this finds you well and to talk soon. JAK
